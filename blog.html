                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">A complete roof replacement for semi-detached houses in Newcastle is essential for protecting homes from weather damage. The process involves careful planning due to shared walls and requires coordination with neighbors. Key signs indicating replacement needs include persistent leaks, missing tiles, sagging decks, high energy bills, and aged materials. The replacement process includes inspection, material selection, permit acquisition, old roof removal, repairs, and installation. Costs range from £5,000 to £15,000 depending on size, materials, and repairs needed. Professional contractors should be chosen based on experience with semi-detached properties and local knowledge. Regular maintenance post-replacement ensures longevity.</p>
